# ImpementingDataStructures

!!! DoublyLinkList and circular linklist dont work 
!!! Linklist::deleteElement(T element,std::function ...) method dont work
I try to implementing Data structures with c++17 And I try to learn google test freamwork

if you want to run this code, you must change (additional include,library directories in test project's properties)

TODO
  * Split template class .hpp file -> .hpp and (.tpp or .ipp) 
  * some index control and static assert will be add in LinkLists.cpp
  * more more test
  * ADD BINARY TREE
  * ADD GRAPH
  * Visual Studio Solution to CMake Project
  * Maybe Some heuristic algorithms
  * SFINEA solutions instead of static_assert(has_equality<_T>::value,"error")  
  * AND CHANGE SOLUTION NAME :)))
  
Note : DataStructures project output is static library
