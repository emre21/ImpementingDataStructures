# ImpementingDataStructures

I try to implementing Data structures with c++17 And I try to learn google test freamwork

if you want to run this code, you must change (additional include,library directories in test project's properties)

TODO
  * more more test
  * ADD BINARY TREE
  * ADD GRAPH
  * Visual Studio Solution to CMake Project
  * Maybe Some heuristic algorithms
  * SFINEA solutions instead of static_assert(has_equality<<T>>::value,"error")  
 
Note : DataStructures project output is static library
